The exodus from the Earth then led the Andromeda League to form "terra-selectors", specialists in charge of studying the planets. With the help of technology, terra-selectors have over time become managerial leaders capable of administering entire planets. The management of resources, infrastructures and living species no longer holds any secrets for them.'
